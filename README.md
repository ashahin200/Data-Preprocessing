#  Data Preprocessing and Data Augmenation 

This repository contains material about Data prepocessing with keras and Tensorflow. 
It consists of notebooks as well as python file for various steps for data processing.

### Various process of Data Augmenation:

#  Data Augmenation
+ Image Data Augmentation
+ Sample Image
+ Image Augmentation With ImageDataGenerator
+ Horizontal and Vertical Shift Augmentation
+ Horizontal and Vertical Flip Augmentation
+ Random Rotation Augmentation
+ Random Brightness Augmentation
+ Random Zoom Augmentation
